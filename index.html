            ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
            startup. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
            encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
            about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
            particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
